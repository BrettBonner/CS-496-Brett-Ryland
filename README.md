# CS-496 Senior Project

AssistedLivingDirect aims to create a user-friendly website that will provide an intuitive way for users to search for and access information on assisted living facilities, including their Medicaid Waiver and Senior Assisted Living Subsidy (SALS) certifications. This website will enhance accessibility and streamline the process of finding care facilities.
